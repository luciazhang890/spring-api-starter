## About this Repository

This repository is my personal practice project based on the Spring Boot course by Mosh Hamedani.

I cloned the original starter project and customized it for my own hands-on practice. 
In this project, I am extending the code, configuring the backend, and building RESTful APIs as part of my full-stack learning journey.

The database is managed via Flyway migration, and the backend is built using Spring Boot, MySQL, and JPA.
